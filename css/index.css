/*
 * Due to poor flexbox support, for slides to appear correctly in IE
 * you may need to set height overrides in your css for the following
 * selectors: `.csfd-content-slider.feature-slider` and `.slide img`.
 *
 * For example, for a full-screen-width slider containing 16:9 aspect ratio
 * media, add `height: calc(100vw * 0.5625) !important;` to your css for
 * the selectors named above. For non-full-screen or non-standard media
 * or content sizes, adjust height rule accordingly.
